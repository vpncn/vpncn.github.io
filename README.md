**Best for:** Users who prioritize speed, ease of use, and reliable streaming.

ExpressVPN is a long-established top-tier VPN service and based in the British Virgin Islands (a privacy-friendly jurisdiction). Crucially, ExpressVPN‚Äôs **no-logs policy** has been independently verified. In 2025, auditing firm KPMG confirmed that ExpressVPN‚Äôs servers collect *no* activity or connection logs.

From a security standpoint, it‚Äôs rock-solid.
